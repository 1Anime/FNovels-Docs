## Quick Deploy (Recommended)

1. Click the **Deploy to Vercel** button above.
2. Log in or sign up for a free Vercel account.
3. Follow the prompts to deploy the API. You can use the default settings.
4. Once deployed, your API will be available at `https://your-vercel-project.vercel.app/novel/jellee`.

## Manual Deployment

You can also deploy the API to your own server or another platform by cloning the [Jellee-Storage GitHub repository](https://github.com/JelLee11/Jellee-Storage) and following the instructions in the README.

## Why Self-Host?

- **Reliability:** Your own instance is not affected by public API rate limits or downtime.
- **Customization:** You can modify the code or add your own features.
- **Privacy:** Control your own data and usage.

<Note>
  For most users, the public API is sufficient. Self-hosting is recommended for advanced users or developers.
